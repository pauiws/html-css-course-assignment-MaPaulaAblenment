<h1>Description/Brief</h1>
In this Course Assignment we were asked to make a functioning, responsive website for the assignment brief we chose on Design 1. Here is the link for the Design 1 brief assignment that I chose: https://github.com/NoroffFEU/first-year-cross-course-assignment-brief-two
<h1>Requirements</h1>
•The site needs to have every page listed in the site architecture on the chosen brief. <br>  
•The HTML should be semantic, neatly formatted and valid.
<br>
•The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
<br>
•The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars.
<br>
•Use flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate.
<br>
•The site should be WCAG compliant, and accessibility should be taken into account.
